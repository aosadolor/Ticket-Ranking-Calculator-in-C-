# Ticket-Ranking-Calculator-in-C-
This short program is used to find out which English Premier League team sold the most number of tickets in a season.
Written in C++, it was apart of one of my first assignments on writing functions in CIS 115 at Southwestern College in Chula Vista, Ca.
The program begins with declaring the teams as global variables whose data is used in the several functions of the program.
It consists of two functions, getNumberTickets(), which takes user input as data to be calculated by the findMost() function. Each function uses if/then statements to sort through the string text of 
the team's names, or sort through the quantities given by the user. The program output is displayed through several cin/cout prompts and statements.
There is no user interface coded for this program.
